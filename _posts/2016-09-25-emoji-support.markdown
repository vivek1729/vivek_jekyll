title : "emoji support"
---

I just fell in love with Jekyll a little more now :purple_heart:

Getting emoji support here was a breeze. And I am glad I started with the `github-pages` gem thanks to the folks at Github, for pointing that out! Otherwise on a fresh install of `jekyll`, one would have to just add the [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) gem to their `Gemfile` like  `gem 'jemoji'` and then update the `_config.yml` file to include that gem during building:

```ruby
gems:
  - jemoji
```

Since, I was already using the `github-pages` gem, I didn't have to play around with my `Gemfile` at all.

I have also included a [comprehensive emoji cheat sheet](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) below. Happy emoji :+1:!
