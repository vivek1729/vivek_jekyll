title: "url prettify"

The default urls generated by Jekyll for blog pasts are too verbose. They are of the format : `category//year/month/day/title.html`. This obviously tends to get too long and ugly.

Let's see how we can fix that. I will also go over how to easily create posts so we don't have to populate the front matter in these markdown files every time. I just added the following defaults to my `_config.yml` file to get things started:


```ruby
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "post"
      permalink: "/:title"
      categories: "jekyll starter"
```

The default style for [permalink](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) generation in Jekyll is called `date` and it looks like `/:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title.html`. There are some other predefined styles to as linked in the documentation. I went with `/:title` for my use case. Now that these defaults are specified, all I need to do is spcifiy the `title` attribute in my frontmatter and I am donezo!

Oh, one last thing. I still need to enter the date painstakingly demarked by a '-' followed by the title to save the file. Thankfully there is a handy plugin available! (Yay!! For Sublime). It is called [Sublime Jekyll](http://sublime-jekyll.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is documented very well and has tons of helpful commands with automatic post generation being only one of them.:)
