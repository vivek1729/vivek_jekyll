title:  "Welcome to Jekyll"

Okay, so this is the `hello-world` of my Jekyll world.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Yeah, I get that (^) but not very efficient obviously.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Vivek')
#=> prints 'Hi, Vivek' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
